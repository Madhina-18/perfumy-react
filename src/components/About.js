            <p>Perfume is a liquid that gives people, things and rooms a good smell. It is made of oils which give off scent to the surrounding air. The odoriferous compounds that make up a perfume can be manufactured synthetically or extracted from plant or animal sources.
                Perfume is a form of personal expression. Your choice of fragrance can convey your personality, style, and individuality.
